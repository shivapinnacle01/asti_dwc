                <h3>INFORMATION COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
                <p>
                  Some of our Platform’s functionality may be used without
                  revealing any personal information, though for features or
                  services related to the Programs, personal information is
                  required. If you do not use these specific features or
                  services on the Platform, then the only information we collect
                  will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e., information that
                  cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information
                  includes information such as the web pages that you have
                  viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on
                  our Platform, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable
                  Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify
                  you). Personally Identifiable Information can include, but not
                  be limited to information such as your name, email address,
                  contact number (cellular and landline), educational
                  qualification(s), and post-qualification or work experience
                  among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the
                  accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit
                  to ASTI ACADEMY. Inaccurate information may affect your
                  ability to use the Platform, the information you receive when
                  using the Platform, and our ability to contact you. For
                  example, your email address should be kept current because
                  that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate
                  with you.

                <h4>1.1 NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>
                  When you come to our Platform, we may track, collect and
                  aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other
                  things, which pages of our Platform were visited, the order in
                  which they were visited, when they were visited, and which
                  hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect information from
                  the URLs from which you linked to our Platform. Collecting
                  such information may involve logging the IP address, operating
                  system, and browser software used by each user of the
                  Platform. Although such information is not Personally
                  Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an
                  IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the
                  geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
                </p>
                <h4>1.2 PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>
                  We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you
                  provide to us when you sign-up for email updates or Programs,
                  participate in our public forums, avail of our chat room
                  services, send us to email messages, and/or participate in
                  online events or receive other services on or through our
                  Platform. This information may include, among other things,
                  your name, email address, contact number, educational
                  qualification(s), and post-qualification experience among
                  other things.

                  ASTI ACADEMY, or its Educational Partners and third-party
                  service providers, may, for instance, collect certain
                  information from you in conjunction with assignments, exams,
                  and other assessments related to the online course. For
                  example, as part of a proctored exam for a course, ASTI
                  Academy (or its third-party service providers) may collect
                  certain information from you in order to (a) verify or
                  authenticate your identity or submissions made by you, such as
                  a signature for a test or assignment log, a photograph or
                  recording of you (e.g., using a webcam) or information
                  included on a photo identification card or document, or (b)
                  monitor your performance during an exam to confirm that you
                  are abiding by the applicable test rules or requirements
                  (e.g., confirming that you are not using prohibited
                  resources). ASTI Academy may also collect information from you
                  or about your performance or accomplishments, such as
                  quiz/exam scores, grades, project evaluations, teacher
                  evaluations, and other evaluations of your performance or
                  accomplishments.
                </p>

                <h4>1.3 THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</h4>
                <p>
                  We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you
                  access or log in to a third-party site, e.g., Facebook, or
                  Whatsapp from our Platforms. This may include the text and/or
                  images of your Personally Identifiable Information available
                  from the third-party site. Please be aware that the
                  information we obtain from such third-party Platforms is often
                  dependent on their privacy policies and/or on your settings
                  regarding what information you have consented to share with
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We enter into contracts with third parties to serve ads on our
                  behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this Platform.
                  They may collect information about your visits to our
                  Platform, and your interaction with our products and services.
                  They may also use information about your visits to this
                  Platform and to other websites so as to target advertisements
                  for goods and services. This information is collected through
                  the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology
                  used by most major websites. Such third parties are not
                  permitted to sell or share your personally identifiable
                  information as part of this process. If such third parties
                  sell or share personally identifiable information as part of
                  the process, ASTI ACADEMY shall not be responsible.
                </p>

                <h4>1.4 INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES</h4>
                <p>
                  We may receive information about you if you use any of the
                  other platforms we operate or the other services we provide.
                  In this case, we will inform you when we collect that data and
                  that it may be shared internally and combined with data
                  collected on the Platform. We are also working closely with
                  third parties (including, for example, Educational Partners,
                  sub-contractors in technical, advertising networks, analytics
                  providers, and search information providers) and may receive
                  information about you from such sources. We collect
                  Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the Platform
                  visitors to track the total number of visitors to the Platform
                  in aggregate form and identify the type of Internet web
                  browser (e.g., Internet Explorer®) and operating system (e.g.,
                  Windows®) used by the visitor. This information allows us to
                  continuously improve our Platform and our services.

                  specific Program related information and/or services you
                  select, send you updates about the Programs or other ASTI

                  example, as part of an exam, ASTI Academy may use certain
                  information collected from you in order to verify your
                  identity or to monitor your performance during the exam to
                  confirm that you are abiding by the applicable testing rules
                  or requirements. We may share Personally Identifiable
                  Information that we collect from you when you participate in a
                  Program with the particular Educational Partner (e.g., such as
                  a university or company) that developed or offered the Program
                  and the instructor(s) who taught, managed, or otherwise
                  oversaw the Program or graders who will be assessing your
                  performance or mentors who will be supporting Students. For
                  example, if you are taking a Program through a university, we
                  may share Personally Identifiable Information about you and
                  your performance with the university to report on your
                  progress in the Program. In another example, if you are taking
                  a Program sponsored or paid for by your employer, we may share
                  your grades, evaluations, or progress in the Program with your
                  employer and other Personally Identifiable Information. This
                  information may be shared at any time during the Program or
                  afterward. Personally Identifiable Information shared with our
                  Educational Partners will be subject to the privacy policies
                  and procedures of such partners. Also, we may archive this
                  information and/or use it for future communications with you.

                  We may use your Personally Identifiable Information in order
                  to provide such services to you and for quality control
                  purposes, and we may also archive this information and/or use
                  it for future communications with you. For example, ASTI
                  Academy may make available to you chat room services that
                  allow you to communicate with ASTI Academy staff members and
                  we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide
                  these services to you. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we
                  may share certain Personally Identifiable Information and
                  materials with third parties including but not limited to
                  potential employers and/ or service providers such as Facebook
                  in order to provide you services that you have requested or
                  services ASTI Academy provides in conjunction with the
                  Programs. For example, we may submit your data to potential
                  employers. In another example, ASTI Academy staff members may
                  create groups on Facebook (or similar service providers) and
                  make you a member of such a group. These groups may be used to
                  provide services in conjunction with the Programs including
                  but not limited to updates in relation to the Programs,
                  details of potential employers, etc. Please be aware that the
                  information disclosed on a third-party service provider’s

                  ASTI Academy has put in place various physical, electronic,
                  and managerial procedures to try to safeguard and secure the
                  information we collect. For example, we provide strong
                  encryptions to store certain information and have stringent
                  managerial checks and password change policies in place. The
                  information we collect is stored with third-party data centers
                  which have a holistic security model with seven levels of
                  security. Please note that the Company shall not be liable for
                  any misuse or loss of information carried out by such a
                  third-party data center. Furthermore, we also rely on your
                  cell phone’s strong security model to ensure that there is no
                  information or security leak unless intentionally processed
                  for authentication.
